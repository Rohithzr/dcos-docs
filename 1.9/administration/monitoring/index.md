Monitoring the health of all the pieces that make up DC/OS is vital to datacenter operators and for troubleshoooting hard-to-diagnose bugs. You can monitor the health of your cluster components from the DC/OS UI component health page. The component health page displays information from the system health API, which monitors the core DC/OS components.

DC/OS components are the [systemd units](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) that make up the core of DC/OS. These components are monitored by our internal diagnostics utility (`dcos-3dt.service`). This utility scans all the DC/OS units, and then exposes an HTTP API on each host. For a complete description of the DC/OS components, see the [documentation](/docs/1.9/overview/architecture/components/).

The component health page provides the health status of all DC/OS system components that are running in systemd. You can drill down by health status, host IP address, or specific systemd unit.

## Getting Started
Launch the [DC/OS UI](/docs/1.9/usage/webinterface/) and navigate to the **Components** page. You can sort components by health.

You can click on a DC/OS component to view the details, including role, node, and health.

You can debug further by clicking the node to view the component journald (log) output:

## Health States

Possible health states are unhealthy and healthy. We infer this from codes 0 and 1.

- **Healthy** All cluster nodes are healthy. The units are loaded and not in the "active" or "inactive" state.
- **Unhealthy** One or more nodes have issues. The units are not loaded or are in the "active" or "inactive" state.

The system health API has four possible states: 0 - 3, OK; CRITICAL; WARNING; UNKNOWN. Future DC/OS iterations will leverage these codes to provide more robust and detailed cluster health state information in the UI.

## System health HTTP API endpoint

The system health endpoint is exposed on port `1050` for masters, and through the DC/OS diagnostics utility on the master nodes:

-  Master nodes

   ```bash
   $ curl localhost:1050/system/health/v1
   ```
   
-  Agent nodes

   ```bash
   $ curl --unix-socket /run/dcos/3dt.sock http://localhost/system/health/v1
   ```

## Aggregation

Aggregation of the cluster health endpoints is accomplished by the same diagnostics application, but is only run on the master nodes. You can explore this API further by making a few queries to any master in your cluster:

```bash
$ curl localhost:1050/system/health/v1/units
$ curl localhost:1050/system/health/v1/nodes
$ curl localhost:1050/system/health/v1/report
```

The DC/OS GUI uses these aggregation endpoints to generate the data you explore in the system health console.

## Known Issues

### Misinterpreting System Health by Unit

You can sort system health by systemd unit. However, this search can bring up misleading information as the service itself can be healthy but the node on which it runs is not. This manifests itself as a service showing "healthy" but nodes associated with that service as "unhealthy". Some people find this behavior confusing.

### Missing Cluster Hosts

The system health API relies on Mesos-DNS to know about all the cluster hosts. It finds these hosts by combining a query from `mesos.master` A records as well as `leader.mesos:5050/slaves` to get the complete list of hosts in the cluster.

This system has a known bug where an agent will not show up in the list returned from `leader.mesos:5050/slaves` if the Mesos agent service is not healthy. This means the system health API will not show this host.

If you experience this behavior it's most likely your Mesos agent service on the missing host is unhealthy.

## Troubleshooting

If you have any problems, you can check if the diagnostics service is running by SSH’ing to the Mesos leading master and checking the systemd status of the diagnostics component (`dcos-d3t.service`).
